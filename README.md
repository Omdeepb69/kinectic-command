# Kinectic Command

## Description
An AI system leveraging real-time computer vision to interpret hand gestures from a webcam, translating them into control commands for a simulated drone or robotic arm. It explores intuitive, 'minority report'-style non-contact human-machine interfaces.

## Features
- Real-time hand tracking and landmark detection using webcam input via MediaPipe.
- Customizable gesture recognition engine (rule-based or simple ML) mapping hand poses (e.g., fist, open palm, pointing) to specific actions.
- Simple graphical simulation (e.g., using Pygame) showing a virtual object (drone/arm) responding instantly to gesture commands.
- Visual feedback overlay on the video feed showing detected landmarks and the recognized gesture/command.
- Modular design allowing easy extension for more complex gestures or different simulated objects.

## Learning Benefits
Gain hands-on experience with real-time computer vision pipelines, integrating pre-trained models like MediaPipe, feature extraction from image data (landmarks), developing gesture recognition logic (rule-based or basic ML classification), basic simulation programming, and exploring advanced Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) concepts.
